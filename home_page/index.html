          <p>Before we can talk about what mockjup is, we must first discuss where it came from
            Within the crypto community, there exists many different tokens or sub communities. 
            One of these communities is called Solana. Solana has the advantage of taking less fees
            than its competitors (bitcoin and ethereum) while also being fast and efficient. Within
            the Solana ecosystem, there exists a decentralized exchange (DEX) called Jupiter that
            allows users to trade different tokens in one streamlined process through the use of 
            Automated Market Makers (AMMs). When Jupiter was first preparing to make its own token
            called JUP, it first launched a test token named mockJUP. Many users of Jupiter received
            mockJUP tokens for free and were surprised to find out that it had liquidity (it could
            be sold for real money). A community formed around the token and although it is nowhere
            near its peak price, mockJUP will always have a special place in our hearts for its story.
