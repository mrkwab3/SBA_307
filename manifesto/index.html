    <!-- Manifesto (Terms and Conditions)
    To Instructor: Please note that while all the HTML elements and CSS styling was done on my own,
    the wall of text (and only the text) was generated by ChatGPT. In other words, the styling
    decisions from the h1/4/5s to the div containers and even the hr tags were all my own styling
    choices while I relied on ChatGPT to create the terms and conditions to use as my 'text boilerplate'.
    I'm not sure if I explained this clearly in my comment so feel free to contact me for further
    clarification if necessary. -->
